# Measuring “the” Purchasing Power

This repository provides replication codes for the [working paper linked here](https://fgeerolf.com/mesurer-le-pouvoir-d-achat.html).

## Replication

The repository contains everything needed to replicate the figures and data from the [working paper linked here](https://fgeerolf.com/mesurer-le-pouvoir-d-achat.html):

### Figure 1: Household consumption and investment deflators, Base 100 = 1999

### Figure 2: Household consumption deflator vs. HICP and CPI, COICOP 08 - Communications, Base 100 = 1996

[Code R](figure2.R)
